## About
Sydney Water Asset Review & Maintenance or S.W.A.M.
Is an application we have created to help Sydney Water upgrade from their current work organization method. It is a work organization app designed specifically to their requirements. Displays all of their assets with their work orders. Work Orders can be created and assigned to people and/or departments

## Team
Tobias Virgona(engineer, full stack developer ,de-bugger, deployment) [Github](https://github.com/virgona)
Andrew Dippel(engineer, full stack developer, mastermind, wireframing and planning)

## Purpose

To upgrade the current system in place at Sydney water. Making their jobs easier to manage, therefore making it less prone to user error or confusion. Streamlining the process in which jobs are organized and undertaken from start to finish

## Technologies

Node.js

Express.js

Mongodb

Mongoose

Mongodb Atlas

Heroku

MUI

Graphql / Apollo

GitHub

## Functionality

1. A user is greeted by a login page whereby if they have been verifyed as an employee of Sydney Water they can enter their details to log in

2. User is redirected to the Home page which features all the current jobs and their current status

3. A user clicks on a Daily Job and is taken to the page specific for that job. This page holds all the prefilled details about the asset including being able to view to CCTV footage. Here a work order for the asset can be created at the bottom of the page

4. Filling in a work order requires the user to complete all the text boxes and prompts which is then saved to the database


## Future Development Plans

 - the ability to edit / create assets
 - status is shown by a progress bar
 - The ability to upload CCTV footage (atm it is just a section for the footage)
 - Permissions for managers to create new users
 - Google maps functionality for the location - this will be clickable and take the user to a map
